								<h3>Introduction:</h3>
								<p>As a teacher, I often noticed that some students required significantly more effort to engage in learning, particularly in subjects like Math and Science, 
									which already pose challenges for many. I observed a recurring pattern, students who struggled to connect were often from cultural backgrounds different from my own. 
									Despite creating a safe, welcoming environment and incorporating culturally relevant lessons, engagement gaps persisted. In conversations with colleagues, 
									I found that their experiences with the same students sometimes differed from mine. This inconsistency led me to explore a deeper question: Does the cultural and ethnic 
									alignment between students and teachers influence student engagement? 
								</p>
								<h3>Goal:</h3>
								<p>The goal of this data analysis project investigates the ethnic backgrounds of students and teachers 
									to explore potential patterns that could inform more equitable and effective classroom practices. 
								</p>
								<h3>Process:</h3>
								<h5>Data Acquisition:</h5>
								<p>Data was acquired from <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/">California's Department of Education</a>. The first dataset was the Annual Statewide Enrollment data 
								disaggregated by student race/ethnicity at county, district, and school levels. The second dataset was the Staff Race/Ethnicity Data disaggregated by
								race/ethnicity and staff type at county, district, and school levels. The third dataset was the Public Schools and Districts data which provided location 
								information. All datasets provided county, district, and school codes which allowed for relationships to be made between the datasets.</p>
								<h4>Data Cleaning:</h4>
								<h6>SQL:</h6>
								<p style="width:100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Initial data cleaning and preperation was performed through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 20. 
									Data from each source was aggregated to the school level and charter school data was ommited. The Staff Race/Ethnicity Data was cleaned and relevant 
									columns were filtered and exported to an excel file for processing in python. Below is an example of an SQL query made on the Annual Statewide 
									Enrollment dataset, please refer to my github repository <a href="https://github.com/AntimaPrime/Portfolio/tree/main">here</a>
									for all query code.
								</p>
								<pre style="width:100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
								<code>SELECT cds, studentgroup, totalenrollment, subgrouptotal, rate, schoolname 
FROM [Project Database].[dbo].[stdnt_info] 
WHERE rtype LIKE 'S' 
	AND studentgroup NOT LIKE 'HOM' 
	AND studentgroup NOT LIKE 'FOS'
	AND studentgroup NOT LIKE 'SWD'
	AND studentgroup NOT LIKE 'SED'
	AND studentgroup NOT LIKE 'EL';</code></pre>
								<br>
								<p>SQL was used for the joins between each dataset. Left joins were used to omit charter schools, evaluate missing or erroneous data, or otherwise 
									incongruous data that did not fit the scope of the project. Join query was exported to an excel file to use in data visualization</p>
									<pre style="width:100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><code>SELECT a.*, b.[Total Staff Count], b.teacher_group, b.sub_staff_count, c.Latitude, c.Longitude
FROM [Project Database].dbo.stdnt$ a
LEFT JOIN [Project Database].dbo.staff$ b
ON a.cds = b.cds AND b.teacher_group = a.studentgroup
JOIN [Project Database].dbo.school$ c
ON a.cds = c.cds
WHERE b.teacher_group IS NOT NULL</code>
</pre>
								<h4>Python:</h4>
								<p>First, the Staff Race/Ethnicity data needed the County Codes, District Codes, and School Codes to be concatenated and a '0' added before school codes with
									only 6 digits. Then the data needed a melt tranformation in order to align with the format of the Annual Statewide Enrollment data and allow for a join
									to relate student and teacher race/ethnicity. This transformation populated new rows for each ethnicity/race and related it to it's respective cds code.
									Saved output to excel file for joins in SQL. Below is the python code and can also be found on my github repository 
									<a href="https://github.com/AntimaPrime/Portfolio/tree/main">here</a>.</p>
								<pre style="width:100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><code>import pandas as pd
#import data and put into data frame
staff = pd.read_excel(f"F:\Data Science\Data for Projects\Project_3_Education_Demographic\stage_data.xlsx",
                     sheet_name='staff_stage')
df_staff = pd.DataFrame(staff)

#Checking data types
df_staff.info()

#Convert cds components into strings to build cds value for joins
dtype_map = {'County Code':'str', 'District Code': 'str', 'School Code': 'str'}
df2 = df_staff.astype(dtype_map)

#Add 0 to School Codes that are 6 digits to account for cds structure
df2['School Code'] = df2['School Code'].apply(lambda x: '0' + x if len(x) == 6 else x)
df2['cds'] = df2['County Code'] + df2['District Code'] + df2['School Code']

#cast to int type as other tables imported as int
df2['cds'] = df2['cds'].astype(int)

#melt to "tidy" data for joins
df3 = df2.melt(id_vars=['cds','Total Staff Count'],
              value_vars=['AA','AI','AS','FI','HI','PI','WH','MR','NP' ],
              var_name='teacher_group',
              value_name='sub_staff_count')

df3.to_excel(f"F:\Data Science\Data for Projects\Project_3_Education_Demographic\stage_staff.xlsx", sheet_name='staff', index=False)</code></pre>
								<br>
								<h4>Data Visualization</h4>
								<p>Data Visualizations were created using Microsoft Power BI. Data was imported and calculations were made in table view, information on the disparity factor
									calculation is discussed below.	Longitude and latitude were used in conjunction with the disparity factor to populate a map that shows all public schools 
									and their respective disparity factor. A table was created to show the race/etnicity percentages of both students and teachers. A bar graph was created to 
									show the overall distribution of race/ethnicity of students. The map and slicer is interactive and most visualizations update information based on the 
									school selected in either the map or slicer. Please view pictures of the visualizations at the bottom of the post.
								</p>
								<h4>Disparity Factor:</h4>
								<p>The disparity factor (DF), is the average of the sum of differences between ethnicities of students and teachers, aggregated by school or cds. This factor 
									is used to describe the difference between the etnicity/race of both groups. A DF of 0 represents perfect parity between the ethnicity/race of students
									and teachers while a DF of 100 represents a complete disparity between both groups. The scale ended up being more logrithmic in nature and further work,
									discussed in the Future Work section of this article, seeks to create a linear relationship for the disparity factor. In general, a disparity factor
									of 0 to 4 implies a general alignment in race/etnicity between groups, 5-20 is a significant disparity between race/ethnicity, and 21-100 is a near to 
									complete disparity in race/etnicity between students and teachers.
								</p>
								<h3>Challenges:</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Data cleaning and preperation required transformations of data to align data formats between datasets.</li>
										<li>The disparity factor calculation was difficult to implement using a grouping method, many methods were evaluated but a weighted disparity factor 
											was used for readability.</li>
										<li>Some data did not align between datasets for various reasons and multiple investigations were performed to determine the root cause, specifically 
											some numerical values were integer data types while others were string data types.</li>
										<li>I wanted to demonstrate my SQL skills but using python for the data cleaning and transformations would be more efficient.</li>
										<li>Microsoft Power BI does not allow publishing dashboards without a business account, therefor I can only present screenshots of work done.</li>
										<li>The design is student focused and omits some teacher data due to joining data in SQL. Discussed further in Future Work section.</li>
									</ol>
								<h3>Take Aways:</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Many of the schools with low disparity factor are schools with high populations of White teachers and students, although some schools have both a diverse
										population of students and teachers.</li>
										<li>California has a large percentage of Hispanic students (56.55%) and a large percentage of White teachers (56.58%), which accounts for the majority of 
										disparity.</li>
										<li>Overall, California has reasonable parity between students and teachers and ongoing efforts to draw in teachers with different cultural backgrounds
										should improve the disparity even more.</li>
										<li>Increased parity may lead to increased engagement.</li>
									</ol>
								<h3>Future Work:</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Connecting performance data could elucidate how racial and ethnic parity influences educational outcomes.</li>
										<li>Create values in student data to for race/etnicities not represented to improve relationship between teachers.</li>
										<li>Designing the Disparity Factor as a Parity Factor and function linearly so that a 100 represents 100% parity between students and teachers.</li>
										<li>Use Chi-square test to test whether distributions are significantly different.</li>
